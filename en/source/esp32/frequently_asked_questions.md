## Can't Download Firmware

- Use a better USB cable, or change a USB socket;
- Check and make sure the CP210x drive had been correctly installed, users can refer to this document: [Establish Serial Connection](https://docs.heltec.cn/#/en/user_manual/establish_serial_connection);
- Press "PRG" button before upload.

## Orange LED Blink Problem

Annoying orange LED lights are always flashing? It's because the battery management chip MCP73831. with the following control logic:

- Blink -- Power on
- Bight -- Charging
- Turn OFF -- Battery filled

Change this capacitor to 220nF to temporarily correct this problem.

We had use the TP4054 to replace MCP73831, the orange LED have new control logic:

- Dim -- Power on
- Bight -- Charging
- Turn OFF -- Battery filled

## System Reset All the Time

![](img/frequently_asked_questions/resetallthetime.png)

According to the situation we have collected so far, the most likely to cause a constant reset problem may have two reasons:

- Power supply problem: please make sure the voltage of USB â‰¥ 4.7V, 300mA;
- You chose an error board: because each type of board may have a different FLASH size, and they have a different partition map, it will cause the internal logic error.
