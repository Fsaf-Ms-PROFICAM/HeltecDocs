This document branch is for `Heltec ESP32 + LoRa Node series <https://heltec.org/proudct_center/lora/lora-node/>`_,

ESP32 is a powerfull SoC with 240MHz Tensilica LX6 dual-core & 1 ULP core, 600 DMIPS, 520KB SRAM. The benefit of "ESP32 + LoRa" combination:
-  Multi wireless communication technical on board, include Wi-Fi, BlueTooh/BLE, LoRa;
-  Powerful computing skills;
-  Large FLASH size;
-  Power mananagement system and Li-Po support;
-  Arduino-compitable;
-  We also provide `LoRaWAN-Node protocol Arduino library <https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/ESP32_LoRaWAN>`_;

.. tip::

   ESP32's BlueTooth and Wi-Fi antenna use a same pin, so BlueTooth and Wi-Fi can't work at the same time.
